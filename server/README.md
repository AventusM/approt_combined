# Approt-backend

This repository contains the backend for the approt application.

## Requirements
You need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run the project. Since the expo client uses tunnels in the frontend, you need to setup [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) with a user account.

#### Note, you also need the proper .env file to develop the app store version of the application.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install dependencies with the following command.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

First, start the backend with the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Heroku

[This application is hosted on heroku](https://blooming-escarpment-41791.herokuapp.com)

#### Production changes go through github actions in the main branch
