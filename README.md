### Quick dev setup

1. Read prerequisites in the client/server directories (basically npm install)
2. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.android.emulator.dev.yml up` to run the app in development mode. You need to have the android emulator online at this stage.
3. Alternatively run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.android.device.dev.yml up` to do the same with an actual device. Almost required when working with the camera functionality. Use it with `scrcpy` to mirror the phone on the pc.

### Expo app link (Android). iOS stuff doesn't allow sideloading and requires an 'official' development setup.
